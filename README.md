# Hey there, I'm Eric

I’m a Software Engineer based out of Detroit with a passion for Javascript.

I’m currently working with the great people over at [Dencap Dental Plans](https://dencap.com), but I’m usually available for freelance work. For business inquiries, feel free to shoot me an email. When not working at my day job, I am a founding member of [Neo Interactive](https://neointeractive.dev), an independent game studio developing an upcoming multiplayer action game, [Samurai Zero](https://samuraizero.com) . On the side, I also run [OneGuy Cinematics](https://oneguy.io), a resource for content creators to download high-quality video game cinematics.
